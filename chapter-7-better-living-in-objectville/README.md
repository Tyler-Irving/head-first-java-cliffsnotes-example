## What really is inheritance?
Remember way back in chapter 2, when Larry (procedural guy) and Brad (OO guy) were trying for the Aeron chair? Let's look at a few pieces of that story to review the basics of inheritance.

Look at what all four classes have in common. They're `Shapes`, and they all `rotate` and `playSound`. So Brad abstracted out the common features and put them into a new class called `Shape`. Then he linked the other four shape classes to the new `Shape` class, in a relationship called `inheritance`.

### The Amoeba Rotate?
Brad made the Amoeba class override the rotate() and playSound() methods of the superclass Shape. Overriding just means that a subclass redefines one of its inherited methods when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method.

### Inheritance Breakdown
When you design with inheritance, you put common code in a class and then tell other more specific classes that the common (more abstract) class is their superclass. When one class inherits from another, the subclass inherits from the superclass. In Java, we say that the subclass extends the superclass. An inheritance relationship means that the subclass inherits the members of the superclass. When we say "members of a class" we mean the instance variables and methods.

An Inheritance example:
```java
public class Doctor {
    boolean worksAtHospital;

    void treatPatient() {
        // perform checkup
    }
}

public class FamilyDoctor extends Doctor {
    boolean makesHouseCalls;
    void giveAdvice() {
        // give homespun advice
    }
}

public class Surgeon extends Doctor {
    void treatPatient() {
        // perform surgery
    }

    void makeIncision() {
        // makes incision (yikes!)
    }
}
```
Superclass: Doctor
- worksAtHospital: (one instance variable)
- treatPatient(): (one method)

Subclass: Surgeon
- treatPatient(): (Overrides the inherited treatPatient() method)
- makeIncision(): (Adds one new method)

Subclass: FamilyDoctor
- makesHouseCalls: (Adds one new instance variable)
- giveAdvice(): (Adds one new method)

## Inheritance Tree
Imagine you're asked to design a simulation program that lets the user throw a bunch of different animals into an environment to see what happens. We've been given a list of some of the animals that will be in the program, but not all. We know each animal will be represented by an object, and that the objects will move around in the environment, doing whatever it is that each particular animal is programmed to do. And we want other programmers to be able to add new kinds of animals to the program at any time.

1. Look for objects that have common attributed and behaviors. What do these six types have in common? This helps you to abstract out behaviors. How are these types related? This helps you define the inheritance tree relationships.

2. Design a class that represents the common state and behavior. These objects are all animals, so we'll make a common superclass called Animal. We'll put in methods and instance variables that all animals might need.

3. Decide if a subclass needs behaviors (method implementations) that are specific to that particular subclass type. Looking at the Animal class, we decide the eat() and makeNoise() should be overridden by individual subclasses, since each animal eats differently and does not sound the same.

4. Look for more opportunities to use abstraction, by finding two or more subclasses that might need common behavior. We look at our classes and see that Wolf and Dog might have some behavior in common, and the same goes for Lion, Tiger, and Cat.

5. Finish the class hierarchy. Since animals already have an organizational hierarchy (the whole kingdom, genus, phylum thing), we can use the level that makes the most sense for class design. We'll use the biological "families" to organize the animals by making t=a Feline class and a Canine class. We decide that Canines could use a common roam()method, because they tend to move in packs. We also see that Felines could use a common roam() method, because they tend to avoid others of their own kind. We'll let Hippo continue to use its inherited roam() method-- the generic one it gets from Animal. So we're done with the design for now.

### Animal Super-Class
```java 

public class Animal {
    BufferedImage img;
    String food;
    String hunger;
    String boundaries;
    String location;

    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }

    public sleep() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }

    public roam() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}
```

### Feline Subclass 
```java
public class Feline extends Animal {
    public roam() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}

public class Lion extends Feline {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do 
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}

public class Tiger extends Feline {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do 
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}

public class Cat extends Feline {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do 
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}
```

### Canine Subclass
```java 
public class Canine extends Animal {
    public roam() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}

public class Dog extends Canine {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do 
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this methoc needs to do
    }
}

public class Wolf extends Canine {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}
```

### Hippo Subclass
```java
public class Hippo extends Animal {
    public makeNoise() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }

    public eat() {
        // what this method needs to do
    }
}
```

### Which method is called?
The Wolf class has four methods. One inherited from Animal, one inherited from Canine (which is actually an overridden version of a method in class Animal), ans two overridden in the Wolf class. When you create a Wolf object and assign it to a variable, you can use the dot operator on that reference variable to invoke all four methods. But which version of those methods gets called?

```java
Wolf w = new Wolf();
// Make a new Wolf object

w.makeNoise();
// calls the version in Wolf
w.roam();
// calls the version in Canine
w.eat();
// calls the version in Wolf
w.sleep();
// calls the version in Animal
```

When you call a method on an object reference, you're calling the most specific version of the method for that object type. In other words, the lowest one wins! "Lowest" meaning lowest on the inheritance tree. Canine is lower than Animal, and Wolf is lower that Canine, so invoking a method on a reference to a Wolf object means the JVM starts looking first in the Wolf class. If the JVM doesn't fins a version of the method in the Wolf class, it stars walking back up the inheritance hierarchy until it finds a match

## Using IS-A and HAS-A

Remember that when one class inherits from another, we say that the subclass extends the superclass. When you want to know if one thing should extend another, apply IS-A TEST. Triangle IS-A Shape, yeah that works. Cat IS-A Feline, that works too. Surgeon IS-A Doctor, still good. Tub extends Bathroom sounds reasonable. Until you apply the IS-A test. To know if you've designed your types correctly, ask, "Does it make sense to say X IS-A Y?" If it doesn't, you know there's something wrong with the design, so if we apply IS-A test, Tub IS-A Bathroom is definitely false. What if we reverse it to Bathroom extends Tub? That still doesn't work, Bathroom IS-A Tub doesn't work. Tub and Bathroom are related, but not through inheritance. Tub and Bathroom are joined by a HAS-A relationship. Bathroom has a Tub instance variable. In other words, Bathroom has a reference to a Tub, but Bathroom does not extend Tub and vice-versa.

## What Does Inheritance Really Buy You

You get a lot of OO mileage by designing with inheritance. You avoid duplicate code by abstracting out the behavior common to a group of classes, and sticking that in a superclass. You will only need to modify in one place instead of all places the behavior is presented. Make the change and compile the class again. You don't have to touch the subclasses! Just deliver the newly-changed superclass, and all classes that extend it will automatically use the new version. As long as the superclass doesn't break anything for the subclass, everything's fine. Inheritance lets you guarantee that all classes grouped under a certain supertype have all the methods that the supertype has. In other words, you define a common protocol for a set of classes related through inheritance. When defining methods in a superclass, that can be inherited by other subclasses, you're announcing a kind of protocol to other code that says, "All my subtypes (subclasses) can do these things, with these methods that look like this...". In other words, you established a contract.

## Polymorphism

The three steps of object declaration and assignment:
```java 
Dog myDog = new Dog();
```
Declare the reference variable--Tells the JVM to allocate space for a reference variable. The reference variable is, forever, of type `Dog`. In other words, a remote control has buttons to control a `Dog`, but not a `Cat` or a `Button` etc. Create an object--Tells JVM to allocate space for a new `Dog` object on the garbage collectible heap. Link the object and reference--Assigns the new `Dog` to the reference variable `myDog`. In other words, program the remote control. The important point is that the reference type AND the object type are the same. But with polymorphism, the reference and the object can be different.
```java
Animal myDog = new Dog();
```
The two (Animal and Dog) are NOT the same type. The reference variable type is declared as Animal, but the object is created as a new Dog(). With polymorphism, the reference type can be a superclass of the actual object type. When you declare a reference variable, any object that passes the `IS-A` test for the declared type of the reference variable can be assigned to that reference. In other words, anything that `extends` the declared reference variable type can be `assigned` to the reference variable. This lets you do things like make polymorphic arrays.
```java 
Animal[] animals = new Animal[5];
// Declare an array of type Animal. In other words, an array that will hold objects of type Animal.
animals[0] = new Dog();
animals[1] = new Cat();
animals[2] = new Wolf();
animals[3] = new Hippo();
animals[4] = new Lion();
// But look what you get to do... you can put ANY subclass of Animal in the Animal array!

for (int i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    // And here's the best polymorphic part, you get to loop through the array and call one of the Animal-class methods, and every object does the right thing!

    animals[i].eat();
    // When 'i' is 0, a Dog is at index 0 in the array, so you get the Dog's eat() method. When 'i' is 1, you get the Cat's eat() method.

    animals[i].roam();
    // Same thing with roam().
}
```

## Keeping the Contract: rules of overriding
When overriding a method from a superclass, you're agreeing to fulfill the contract. The methods are the contract. If polymorphism is going to work, the Toaster's version of the overridden method from Appliance has to work at runtime. Remember, the compiler looks at the reference type to decide whether you can call a particular method on that reference. With an Appliance reference to a Toaster, the compiler cares only if class Appliance has the method you're invoking on an Appliance reference. But at runtime, the JVM looks not at the reference type (Appliance) but at the actual Toaster object on the heap. If the compiler has already approved the method call, the only way it can work is if the overriding method has the same arguments and return types. Otherwise, someone with an Appliance reference will call turnOn() as a no-arg method, even though there's a version in Toaster that takes an int. Which one is called at runtime? The one in Appliance. In other words, the turnOn(int level) method in Toaster is not an override!

Arguments must be the same, and return types must be compatible--whatever the superclass takes as an argument, the subclass overriding the method must use the same argument. Whatever the superclass declares as a return type, the overriding method must declare either the same type, or a subclass type.

The method can't be less accessible--Access level must be the same, or friendlier. Can't override a public method and make it private.

### Overloading a method
It is nothing more than having two methods with the same name but different argument lists. There's no polymorphism involved with overloaded methods! An overloaded method is just a different method that happens to have the same method name. It has nothing to do with inheritance and polymorphism. An overloaded method is NOT the same as an overridden method.

The return types can be different--You can change the return types in overloaded methods, as long as the argument lists are different.

You can't change ONLY the return type--If the return type is the only difference, the compiler will assume you are overriding the method. Won't work unless the return type is a subtype of the return type declared in the superclass. To overload a method, you MUST change the argument list, although you can change the return type to anything.

You can vary the access levels in any direction--Can overload a method with a method that's more restrictive since the new method isn't obligated to fulfill the contract of the overload method.
```java
public class Overloads {
    String uniqueID;
    public int addNums(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    public double addNums(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    public void setUniqueID(String theID) {
        // lots of validation code, and then:
        uniqueID = theID;
    }
    public void setUniqueID(int ssNumber) {
        String numString = " " + ssNumber;
        setUniqueID(numString);
    }
}
```
