## The way Java Works
Java follows four steps
1. Source Code
- The first step is the programmers (you) work. The code is written here.
2. Complier
- The second step is where the source code that was written in step 1 is checked to make sure that it is written correctly and 
can be successfully ran.
3. Output Code
- The third step is started when the compiler ok's the code, and makes the output code. Output code is Java bytecode, and can be read by any device that has the ability to understand java. This code is completely platform-independent.
4. Virtual Machines
- Your friends donâ€™t have a physical Java Machine, but they all have a virtual Java machine (implemented in software) running inside their electronic gadgets. The virtual machine reads and runs the bytecode.

## Code Structure in Java 
Java's code structure of 3 things: the source file, class/es, and a main method.

## The main() method
The main method is the leader of the group. The java file depends on this method to even know what to do. Inside of this method is how y
